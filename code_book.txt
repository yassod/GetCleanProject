This project uses the human activity data collected using Samsung Galaxy S smartphone by researchers
at UC Irvine for a project called "Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions".
Details of the research and data set are at: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]() and referenced in these notes.


The final data table has numeric value columns for these variables for each Measure:
        - Mean of Mean
        - Mean of Standard Deviation
        - Mean of Mean Frequency (Mean Frequency is the weighted average of the frequency components)

Parameters of Measures
        Subject:  numeric IDs for 30 test subjects

        Activity: 6 activities tested:
                1 WALKING
                2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
                3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
                4 SITTING
                5 STANDING
                6 LAYING
        
        Domain: whether the data is a measured in the original Time domain, captured at 50 Hz, or Frequency, after the original time data is filtered to remove noise

        Source: The source of linear acceleration (either Body or Gravity) or the source of angular velocity (this is always Body motion).

        Measure: Linear Acceleration, Linear Acceleration Jerk, Angular Velocity, Angular Velocity Jerk; the Jerk measures are derived in time from the Body Linear Acceleration and Body Angular Velocity.

        Axis: 3D measurement isolated in X, Y or Z axis, or Magnitude for the combination of the three axes

Data Units
        - The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg^2).
        - The gyroscope angular velocity units are radians/seg.
